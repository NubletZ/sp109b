# Week 1 Notes
## GCC
GCC is a collection of programming compilers including various languages such as ada, C, C++, fortran, ObjC, Fortran, and Java.
This GCC is a key component of "GNU Toolchain" that includes GNU Make, an automation tool for compiling and building applications. In this System Program course, GNU Make will often be use to help in compiling program.
### GNU Make
By default, Make will reads a description of a project from a makefile that is in the same current directory.A makefile is a file that specifies a set of compilation rules in term of targets (such as executables) and their dependencies(such as object files and source files).
